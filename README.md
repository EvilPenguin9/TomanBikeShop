# Portfolio Project 1 - SQL and PowerBI - Toman Bike Shop 

Welcome to my first portfolio project. In this data cleaning, analysis and visualisation project, I clean the Toman Bike Shop dataset with SQL, then visualise it as an interactive dashboard with PowerBI and also export a static version of the dashboard as a PDF.

Project Guide

here a PDF of the Dataset columns which i used for visualisation in PowerBI.

I then further process the data in Power Query ("Transform data" on the Home tab), renaming columns, changing columns' data type etc. and bring the columns into a format suitable for visualisation.

Finally, I visualise the data as an interactive dashboard in PowerBI. I also export a static version of the dashboard as a PDF

**Project Files**

I am unable to upload the full "divvy-tripdata Data Warehouse version 2024-2025" file (1.13 GB) here on my GitHub due to file size limit of 25 MB. 

here's a link to the dataset: (https://github.com/Gaelim/YT_bike_share)

With that, I began my SQL querying and analysis.

**Future Project Aim**

In addition to SQL and R, I konw all litte Python. Once I improve my Python knowledge sufficiently, I aim to set up and automate where can can.
