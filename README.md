# Portfolio Project 1 - SQL and PowerBI - Toman Bike Shop 

Welcome to my first portfolio project. In this data cleaning, analysis and visualisation project, I clean the Toman Bike Shop dataset with SQL, then visualise it as an interactive dashboard with PowerBI and also export a static version of the dashboard as a PDF.

I then further process the data in Power Query ("Transform data" on the Home tab), renaming columns, changing columns' data type etc. and bring the columns into a format suitable for visualisation.

Finally, I visualise the data as an interactive dashboard in PowerBI. I also export a static version of the dashboard as a PDF
