# Portfolio Project 1 - SQL and PowerBI - Toman Bike Shop 

Welcome to my first portfolio project. In this data cleaning, analysis and visualisation project, I clean the AdventureWorks dataset with SQL, then visualise it as an interactive 3-page dashboard with PowerBI and also export a static version of the dashboard as a PDF.

Project Guide

The 4 CSV data tables are the output of the SQL queries, where I clean the tables by sorting and exporting only those columns which are needed for visualisation in PowerBI
